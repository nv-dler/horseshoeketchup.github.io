DLER (Deep Learning Efficiency Research) is a research team at NVIDIA led by Pavlo Molchanov.

We are a dynamic research group, working within the Learning and Perception Research group (LPR) and collaborating closely with other organisations within NVIDIA.

Our interests include the development of new architectures and method for efficient LLM inference and training, pre-training of small language models, development of efficient vision-to-language models, and general improvements of deep learning models with an eye on their memory footprint, inference latency, and energy consumption.

**We are currently looking for deep learning researchers to join us.**
